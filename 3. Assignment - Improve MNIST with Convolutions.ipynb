It should happen in less than 10 epochs, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, but your training must end once it hits the above metric.

During the preprocess step you can apply transformations to the dataset that will be fed into your convolutional neural network.\n","\n","Here you will apply two transformations to the data:\n","- Reshape the data so that it has an extra dimension. The reason for this \n","is that commonly you will use 3-dimensional arrays (without counting the batch dimension) to represent image data. The third dimension represents the color using RGB values. This data might be in black and white format so the third dimension doesn't really add any additional information for the classification process but it is a good practice regardless.\n","\n","\n","- Normalize the pixel values so that these are values between 0 and 1.
